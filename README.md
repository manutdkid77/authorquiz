# AuthorQuiz

This is a basic react app, where I will learn about Components, Events, JSX, State and Testing using Jest and enzyme from the Pluralsight Course [React Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-fundamentals/table-of-contents). 

We are building a quiz type game, where an image of an author will be shown and with 4 options available we have to select the correct option.

I have created a [markdown gist](https://gist.github.com/manutdkid77/7c350cd556822e104ee0997f505d4887) documenting the links, notes, steps, and other useful information.
